                    This one is very different from natural magic. Some people usually get this power from discovering of how to have magic. Such is usually bad. Most people learn this in order to get their own benifit, such as having money. This also is just used to decieve  people, but not real power. It depends on how rapidity the person who has got it is. As a result people just believe that it is a real magic.
